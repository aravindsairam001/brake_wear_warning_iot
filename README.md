## Project Overview
This project introduces an IoT-based real-time brake pad wear monitoring system for reaction beam caliper brakes. The system detects brake pad wear and alerts the responsible person via SMS and a cloud dashboard, thereby preventing accidents due to worn-out pads.

The project integrates:
- Brake pad wear sensor  
- Arduino Nano microcontroller  
- GSM module  
- ThingSpeak IoT platform

---

## Problem Statement
- Brake failure causes ~22% of road accidents globally.  
- Dashboard indicators for pad wear are often ignored.  
- Lack of preventive action leads to longer braking distances and higher risk.

---

## Objectives
- Provide text message alerts on brake pad wear.  
- Notify users via mobile, improving effectiveness over dashboard indicators.  
- Enable centralized, cloud-based monitoring via IoT.

---

## Existing vs Proposed System
### Existing:
- Dashboard light indicator  
- No remote access or persistent logging

### Proposed:
- Text alerts sent to registered mobile numbers  
- Real-time data upload to ThingSpeak for historical analysis  
- Supports remote diagnosis and manufacturer-side failure analysis

---

## Methodology
### System Architecture
- **Wear sensor** detects pad thickness drop  
- **Arduino Nano** processes sensor data  
- **GSM Module** sends SMS and pushes data to **ThingSpeak**  
- **ThingSpeak Dashboard** visualizes wear level over time

### Flowchart and Algorithm
1. Sense brake pad thickness  
2. Upload data to ThingSpeak  
3. If critical level is reached:  
   - Confirm after rechecking  
   - Trigger SMS alert  
   - Upload to ThingSpeak

## Hardware and Software
### Hardware
- **Brake Pad Wear Sensor**: Conductive wire closes circuit when wear limit is breached  
- **Arduino Nano**: Controls logic and communication  
- **GSM Module (SIM900A)**: For SMS and internet connectivity  
- **9V Battery**: Portable power source

### Software
- **Arduino IDE**: Microcontroller programming  
- **ThingSpeak IoT Platform**: Data collection, visualization, and analysis

---

## Working Principle
- Brake pad wear sensor detects critical thickness  
- Signal sent to Arduino Nano  
- GSM sends alert to driver via SMS  
- ThingSpeak server logs brake condition in real-time

---

## ThingSpeak Data Monitoring
- Displays "Kilometer Left vs Time" graphs  
- Alerts when critical thresholds are exceeded  
- Helpful for predictive maintenance and failure analysis

---

## Advantages
- Prevents accidents due to unnoticed brake wear  
- Easily integrates with existing brake caliper systems  
- Enables data analytics and server-side diagnostics  
- Cost-effective and scalable

---

## Disadvantages
- Requires GSM network and internet  
- Hardware must be protected from heat and vibrations

---

## Results & Conclusion
### Results
- System detects brake pad wear accurately  
- Sends SMS alerts in critical scenarios  
- Successfully logs real-time data to ThingSpeak

### Conclusion
A low-cost, IoT-based safety upgrade to conventional braking systems that improves responsiveness, enhances safety, and enables digital diagnostics.
